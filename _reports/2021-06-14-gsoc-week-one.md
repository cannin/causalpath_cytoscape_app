## Coding Phase

This is the period of GSoC where the students started to write code and started contributing to the Open Source Community.  
This phase spans until the end of the program. During this period, two evaluations are done to keep a track of the progress the student is making. The first evaluation starts on 16th July and the final one marks the end of the program.

## Work Progress

1. **Design and Start Implementing the Interface**  
    Status: **Under Development**  
    **Issue:** [Create different UI component for the Cytoscape App](https://github.com/cannin/causalpath_cytoscape_app/issues/9)



## Conclusion  

The week was a great start to my open source journey.<br>
I hope that I would grow in this Coding Period and be a good contributor to the open-source community.
